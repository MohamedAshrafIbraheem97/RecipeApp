- **Angular:** Frontend framework for building robust and scalable web applications
- **TypeScript:** The primary language used in Angular development
- **HTML/SCSS:** For structuring and styling the application
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive and mobile-first design
- **Vercel:** For deployment
- **Git/Github:** For source control
- **Spoonacular:** For API

## Used Folder Structure
1. core: contains endpoints configrations and interceptors
2. recipe: contains components, models and service
3. favorite-recipe: contains a component for listing all favorite recipes
4. shared: contains shared components like recipe card.

## why this structure
1. I belive in lazy loading so i tried to make the minimal modules i can
2. I used local storage to store favorite recipes this is why i tried to put the methods on the recipe service so all related data on one single file and to change on one single place when adding firestore
3. Bootstrap for easier design and pre-made components
4. I used end-points constants file so we might want to add more links for mockup server for example
